# Use inheritance to DRY up the classes. Note - a car is NOT in a type of bicycle, and a bicycle is NOT a type of car!
# To test it, create a bicycle and car instance from your newly modified classes (you can create them at the bottom of your file). First, have them accelerate. Then, make sure a bike can “Ring ring!” and a car “Beeeeeeep!”
